# Snowfall Simulation using p5.js

This is a project that simulates snowflakes falling from the sky like a beautiful snowfall.

- [ ] Create a snowflake object with variable sizes
- [ ] Give that snowflake physics so that it falls like an actual snowflak (more floaty, doesn't fall straight down, etc.)
- [ ] Create a pretty background that resembles the sky during a snowfall (gradient background)
