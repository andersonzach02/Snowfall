# Snowfall Simulation using p5.js

This is a project that simulates snowflakes falling from the sky like a beautiful snowfall.

- [x] Figure out algorithm for creating a snowflake
  - Koch Fractal Algorithm
    -Kind of slow to draw so many segments and update them all. Makes the effect seem weird in the browser.
- [x] Create a sample, static snowflake in the browser
- [x] Create a snowflake object with variable sizes
- [x] Create a simple physics engine for the snowflake to fall
- [x] Apply snowflake physics so that it falls like an actual snowflake (more floaty, doesn't fall straight down, etc.)
- [x] Create a bunch of snowflakes to fall from the sky
- [ ] Create a pretty background that resembles the sky during a snowfall (gradient background)
